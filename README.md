A focus timer based on the famous Pomodoro technique

## What is Pomodoro technique?

Promodoro technique is a highly effective productivity technique that follows very few simple steps to use it in your day to day activities. The steps are as follows:

* Pick a task that you want to complete.
* Give a pessimisstic ETA for the completion of the task.
* Divide the task ETA into chunks of 25 minutes each.
* Now set a timer for 25 minutes and focus on the task, avoiding any distractions possible. (Tip: if distracted immediately make a note of that distraction somewhere and get back to the active task)
* After completion of 25 minutes take a short break of 5 minutes. Drink a small glass of water, talk a quick 1 minute break, visit the distraction notes and entertain that distraction in this time.
* Start the timer of 25 minutes again to continue working on the task.
* After 4 such pomodoro sessions of 25 minutes, take a long 10 minutes break. Start the session again until all the chunks for the tasks are done or the tasks is completed.

## Benefits of this technique

In 1 Pomodoro cycle of 2 hours and 5 minutes you have worked with full focus for 1 hour and 40 minutes and played for 25 minutes (3 short breaks and 1 long break).

## Why this app?

Over the years this technique has helped me a lot in staying productive throughout the day. I have used simple stopwatch for tracking each session and breaks. Over the time the process got a bit hectic and I would fall off the wagon and forget about tracking the time. I used many apps available on the app store or play store, they were either paid or cluttered with ads. You do not want to get distracted by ads while using the technique which was made to avoid distractions in the first place. So I thought to create this app which will exist as a web as well as installable version, to be made available free of cost to anybody who is interested to use it.
